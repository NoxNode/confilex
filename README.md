# confilex
A console file explorer all in C. Open confilex.c for TODOs.

Usage:

W or I to go up

A or J to go to parent directory

S or K to go down

D or L to go into selected directory (don't try it on files, it'll probably crash)

F or O to open the selected file

Q or U to type the directory you want to go to next

E or P to exit

Note: D and L only work on directories, you'll get an error message if you try to do these on files
Note: Double press F or O to open a directory in File Explorer
Known bug: sometimes going to parent directory doesn't work
